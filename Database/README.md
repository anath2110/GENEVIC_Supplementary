# PGS Rank Database

This directory includes:
- PGS_DBschema.pdf and PGS_DBschema.png: The detailed database schema in pdf and png formats, respectively.
- LinkToPGSRankDB.md: Contains the downloadable link to our custom database, "PGS Rank Database", that includes variant ranking corresponding to all PGS score IDs for three main phenotypes, namely, Alzheimer, Schizophrenia, and Cognition.
- pgsAdScCog_top100each_tot300rows.db and pgsAdScCog_top100each_tot300rows.zip: Downloadable .db and .zip files, respectively. 
  -- Derived form the above database. Contains information regarding only the top 100 ranks for each of the 3 phenotypes.

This database, inspired by [The Polygenic Score Catalog Website](https://www.pgscatalog.org/), serves as a pivotal resource and the sample genetic database that is utilized to demo the functionality of the "PGS Chat" interface of the intelligent chat assistant, "GENEVIC". This specialized database is designed to facilitate the exploration and analysis of gene-disease associations, providing researchers with comprehensive variant ranks corresponding to three different phenotypes, 

The original .csv files used to create the corresponding tables in the database can be downloaded from [here](https://www.pgscatalog.org/downloads/#dl_ftp_list).
The metadata describing each of the tables and its columns are explained [in this website link](https://www.pgscatalog.org/downloads/#dl_ftp_list).
