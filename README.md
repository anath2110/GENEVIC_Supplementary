# GENEVIC: Supplementary Materials

## Overview
This repository contains all supplementary materials to support the project "GENEVIC".
### Diagrammatic Overview

Below is a diagram describing the workflow between the three functionalities of GENEVIC and the back-end tech-stack:

Workflow overview between the front-end user interface and the back-end architecture of GENEVIC: (i) User prompts from the interface are sent to the back-end for processing and then, (ii) Generated output is sent back to the user. The backend comprises common AI services, supported by data tools exclusive to each of the three functionalities: PGS Chat (I), GENEAPI Chat (II), and Literature Search (III). The user prompts: Prompt Ia, Prompt IIa, Prompt IIb, Prompt IIIa and Prompt IIIb generate GENEVIC outputs: Output Ia, Output IIa, Output IIb, Output IIIa and output IIIb, respectively.
#### Contents:

- **Database:**
  - **PGS Rank Database Schema Diagram** (JPG and PDF formats): 
    - Diagrammatic representation of the database's tables, indices, key constraints, and relationships.
  - **PGS Rank Database File** (.db file): 
    - A sample database of reduced size, featuring only the top 300 genesâ€”100 each for Alzheimer's, Schizophrenia, and Cognitive traits. This subset is used to deploy our application "GENEVIC" in the Streamlit community cloud.
